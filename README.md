# ❓ Where are all my repositories?
I recently deleted all of my repositories from GitHub and moved them over to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/naomi). Why? Because I don't want my code to be used to train AIs and I want the platform I use to store my open-source code on to be open-source itself. There are a few other reasons, but those are the main two.

# ❓Are you allowed to upload my code to GitHub?
No. Please do not upload my code to this website, if you want to work on a fork - please fork it *on* Codeberg or another open-source git host.

# ❓ Will I ever come back to GitHub?
Probably not. Unless Microsoft allow people to opt-out of AI training (currently it works based on your license/repo visibility) and open-source the website - I do not see myself ever returning. I will *very occasionally* submit a PR to other people's code but my own projects will not be found here.
